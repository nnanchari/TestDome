/* Each item in a web shop belongs to a seller. To ensure service quality, each seller has a rating.

The data are kept in the following two tables:

TABLE sellers
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  rating INTEGER NOT NULL

TABLE items
  id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(30) NOT NULL,
  sellerId INTEGER REFERENCES sellers(id)
Write a query that selects the item name and the name of its seller for each item that belongs to a seller with a rating greater than 4. The query should return the name of the item as the first column and name of the seller as the second column. */

select i.name,s.name from sellers s, items i where s.id=i.sellerid and s.rating >4;
